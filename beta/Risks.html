			<p class="nerop default">The use of mercury in the mining industry 
			to amalgamate precious metals dates from about 
			2700 B.C.E (Lacerda 1997a; Rojas et al 2001). 
			The total number of gold miners around the world using mercury 
			to produce gold ranges from 3 to 5 million including 650,000 in 
			Brazil, 250,000 in Tasmania, 250,000 in Indonesia and 150,000 in 
			Vietnam (Jernelov and Ramel 1994). In modern Brazil, where gold rush 
			has been present since 1980, at least 2000 tons of mercury were released,
			contaminating sediments, soils, fish, and human tissues; a similar situation
			happened in Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, and Bolivia (Malm 1998). Cases of human mercury contamination 
			have been reported from various sites around the world ever since it was used as the major technique to produce gold 
			and other precious metals in South America hundreds of years ago (de Lacerda and Solomons 1998). Mercury poisoning in 
			humans is due to the elevated mercury concentrations in air, water, diet, hair, urine, blood, and other tissues (Eisler 2003). 
			The presence of mercury in living organisms is one of the causes of cancer, 
			birth defects, and other undesirable outcomes (Eisler 2000). 
			In the case of Lobo, cyanide spill is the main threat. According to Engr. 
			Chips Guevarra that the most concerning aspect of the project is the method 
			of using cyanide to separate the gold from the rock. 
			Cyanide is one of the most toxic chemicals in the world. Spills of cyanide have a huge impact in technology 
			since gold is widely 
			used in making the components of our gadgets. If gold were to be fully depleted manufacturers would increase their
			prices and their products will be less reliable.
				</p>
		
			<p class="nerop default"><b>Figure 9</b> showed that there was a significant decrease 
			of gold from 2010 to 2012 already. It is not too far-fetched that this trend might continue. 
			Due to the jobs and other benefits given to the locals, they initially agreed with the project. 
			However, because of the hazardous effects that could result in harming not only the locals but 
			also to Verde Island in the long run, the locals have currently changed their mind resulting to 
			its shut down (Manalo, 2018). From the current findings, shutting down can be described as a 
			good decision in the meantime, until better and more sustainable mining practices are determined. 
			These have already resulted to human casualties and massive fish kills. 
			The cyanide solution will end up in silt pits 
			and when the silt pit dam breaks the cyanide will spill into the ocean, endangering marine life (Ranada, 2015).  </p>

			<p class="nerop subtitle"><i>Figure 9: Amount of Gold mined in the Philippines			
			Source: Fong-sam (2017). The Mineral Industry of the Philippines. 2014. Minerals Yearbook. 
			Retrieved from https://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2014/myb3-2014-rp.pdf</i></p>
			<p class="nerop default">Gold being one of the rarest minerals in the world
			making up roughly 0.003 parts per million of the earth&rsquo;s crust it is a non-reactive mineral which means it tends to remain 
			there until it sinks deep into the earth&rsquo;s core because 
			of its high-density characteristics.
			If gold suddenly disappeared it would not only make a huge impact 
			geographically but rather, economically based on the chart above this tells us that our gold supply is decreasing since it is increasing in price.
			It would also have a huge impact on technology since gold is widely used in
			making the components of our gadgets. If gold were to be fully depleted manufacturers 
			would increase their prices and their products will be less reliable. Goldman Sachs 
			analyst Eugene King estimated that humans have only 20 years&rsquo; 
			worth of mineable reserves of gold in Earth. Eventually, the only possible gold source once reserves 
			on Earth are depleted are the moon and many near-Earth 
			asteroids, which are said to contain trillions of dollars' worth of precious metals and other minerals.</p>

				<h2 class="neroh2">C.	Others</h2>
				
				<p class="nerop default">Aside from the risks related to the mineral itself, there are also risks
				relating to the possible effects it has to local ecology and biodiversity. The plans 
				for gold mining in Verde Island Passage, if not handled carefully, may cause severe pollution 
				and long-term harm to the livelihood, farms, and fisheries of 
				over 2 million people (Jimeno, 2015). The value of gold fluctuates in a volatile way. 
				Based on the chart above the research group can determine that gold 
				prices this last 5 years are increasing which tells us that our gold supply is decreasing.</p>
