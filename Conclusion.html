		<h1 class="neroh1">{ Conclusion }</h1>
		<p class="nerop default">As a conclusion to this study, the researchers found that the methods utilized in extracting the minerals in Lobo, Batangas are not only harmful to the biodiversity but also have  long-term effects to the inhabitants of Lobo, Batangas. This is because of the hazardous chemicals that are used in the site. With the data collected on the estimation of how much gold is mined in Lobo, Batangas, the researchers conclude that it is almost exhausted because in the past 3 years, the trend of gold prices in the Philippines is steadily increasing.
		The researchers recommend that companies invest less on extracting minerals and more on researching how to sustain the gold that is already in circulation. The gold people have access to is already abundant in amount, it is just that they do not know how to use it at maximum efficiency.The high value of gold is due to the few amount of known methods to sustain the current extracted supply, so maintaining what people have should be the next top priority.
		If gold mining is to continue, companies can make sure to reduce the overall trace of the mining area. Biomining is a type of mining that ensures a possibility of reducing land disruption (miningfacts.org, 2012). Alongside mining is the output of it. Mining companies should have an effective waste management plan in order to avoid contamination of surrounding areas (miningfacts.org, 2012).</p>
