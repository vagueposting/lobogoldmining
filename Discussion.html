				<p class="nerop default">Based on the research findings, it can be observed 
				that the potential costs of gold mining in Batangas outweigh the benefits. 
				Based on the research gold mining in Lobo, Batangas can be described as having low level 
				of sustainability.  Due to the mining practices that can harm the biodiversity of Lobo, exhaust minerals,
				and the livelihood of the locals, gold mining is both environmentally and economically unsustainable. 
				Environmental sustainability is the responsible use and interaction with the 
				environment to prevent degradation. Gold mining in Lobo, Batangas was found environmentally 
				unsustainable because cyanide is used in the extraction process, to separate the mineral from the rock is potentially dangerous. 
				 Cyanide is a very toxic chemical that if not disposed properly, 
				humans and marine life of the Verde Island will be in danger.
				Economic sustainability refers to the ability to sustain a livelihood indefinitely. From the findings,
				 it is apparent that this is not the case with gold mining in Lobo Batangas. Mining companies tend to 
				 exhaust as much as possible on the minerals that they are mining to sell more and generate more income
				 for the mining company but in the long run, these minerals will run out. Ecological sustainability refers
				 to sustaining the primary needs of the present generation without endangering the needs of the future generation.
				 In the mining project, this is not the case as it poses a threat to the nearby farms as it can cause severe pollution
				 and long-term harm to the farmersâ€™ livelihood and income.  
				Gold has been steadily increasing its value since 2015 due to shortage in supply. While those fortunate enough to mine gold
				 can benefit from the high demand low supply situation, gold will eventually run out, which means it could 
				 again, be potentially economically unsustainable. <a href="risks 2.0.html">Figure 9: Amount of Gold in the Philippines</a> showed that 
				 there was a significant decrease of gold from 2010 to 2012 already. It is not too far-fetched that this trend might continue. 
				Due to the jobs and other benefits given to the locals, they initially agreed with the project. However, 
				because of the hazardous effects that could result in harming not only the locals but also to Verde Island 
				in the long run, the locals have currently changed their mind resulting to its shut down (Manalo, 2018). 
				From the current findings, shutting down can be described as a good decision in the meantime, until better
				 and more sustainable mining practices are determined.
