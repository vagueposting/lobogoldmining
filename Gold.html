				<p class="mooncell">Gold is a native element; however, it is usually found impure, 
				with small amounts of silver, sometimes iron and copper. 
				These impurities result in slight differences in coloration. 
				It has a Molecular Weight, Moisotopic Mass and Exact Mass of 196.967 g/mol. 
				It has a boiling point of 2700 deg C and a melting point of 1064.76 deg C. It is Insoluble in water,
				 acid and soluble in Potassium Cyanide,
				 Hot Sulfuric Acid, aqua regia.  It is extremely inactive and can
				 be superficially attacked by halogens at room temperature. It’s heat of
				 vaporization is 324 kJ/mol (PubChem, 2018).</p>

				<p class="mooncell">As of the time of writing, it has a price commodity of 1250 USD. The price of gold is constantly
				 shifting due to minute differences in supply and demand. The gold reserve in the second quarter of 2018 is 196.40 Tonnes 
				 compared to the amount in the first quarter, has increased 40 Kilograms. The average of the country’s gold reserves from 2000
				 until 2018 is 192.23 Tonnes. It reached the all-time high of 274.42 Tonnes in the first quarter of 2003 and all-time lowest 
				 record was 126.89 Tonnes in the third quarter of 2007 (Trading Economics, 2018). In 2010 the volume of Gold that was mined 
				 was a total of 40,846 kilograms a 10.3% higher than the previous year which was 37,048%. The value of gold increased 33.6% 
				 from PhP52.77 billion in 2009 to PhP70.51 billion in 2010 (Philippine Yearbook, 2011). Mining gold in the Philippines accounted 
				 for 0.6 percent of its GDP and 6.4 percent of the total exports in 2017 (Kay, 2018).</p>

				<p class="mooncell">The Batangas Project located within the Batangas Mineral District, 
				a mineralized corridor also called the West Luzon Volcanic Arc. 
				Gold and copper-gold are rich in Batangas due to the Talahib volcanic, 
				a sequence of predominantly andesitic volcanics and intrusives exposed in the resource areas at Lobo.
				Gold is created inside massive stars when supernova occurs. As the star explodes, 
				the metal travels to the Earth in some way. Scientists have found that gold arrived 
				Earth through asteroids when Earth was young. Gold deposits are found both at the surface and below the surface of the 
				Earth. Gold can be found in streams, in rock outcroppings and of course below the Earth’s surface. Through hot fluids 
				that circulate gold bearing rocks they form a vein or a lode. Some gold is carried away by water’s current and sinks at the bottom.</p>

			<img src="images/Drilling.jpg" class="neroimg" alt="Extract">
			<p class="mooncell">The Philippine Mining Law states that 
			the state claims all the Mineral resources in the country. 
			There must be a permit or an agreement with the government could be from the different branches of the DENR (like the MGB), 
			the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples, and also from two of the three local governments of the area where the extractions
			 happens before extraction begins these agreements would consist of Exploration permits, Mineral agreements, Financial or Technical
			 Assistance Agreement, The Qualified persons, Government Involvement and Environmental Matters. Under supervision of James Climie, 
			 MRL Gold would be working on geological mapping, ground magnetic survey, rock sampling, pitting, trenching and drilling. Geologic surveys
			 would consist of aeromagnetic surveys and ground magnetic surveys to detect anomalies within the area of extraction. Exploration of the 
			 area would consist of rock sampling and trenching around the West Drift-Bukal Area (Abrasaldo, Climie, Lab-oyan, & de los Santos, 2004). 
			 The process used in the Lobo project is diamond core drilling. Diamond core drilling modified the mining industry and led to the discovery 
			 of many orebodies. There are 3 major operations that happen during the process. First, is the actual drilling into the ground. A “diamond bit” 
			 is used, that is why it is called as it is. A ring-shaped drill bit equipped with diamond is forced to the ground and is rotated clockwise at a
			 high speed. Second, a core sample is cut out from the rock and now can be retrieved and analyzed at the surface. Third, getting a new equipment
			 with lubricated tube to resume the cycle (McCoremick, 2016).</p>
